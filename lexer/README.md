# Lexer

The lexer transforms Monkey source code into a stream of tokens. It processes the raw character input sequentially, identifying and categorizing language elements such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and delimiters.

This is the first stage of the compilation process, converting human-readable source code into a structured token stream that can be efficiently processed by the parser.

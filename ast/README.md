# AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

This crate defines the Abstract Syntax Tree structures for the Monkey language. It provides the foundational data types that represent parsed Monkey code in a structured, hierarchical format.

The AST serves as an intermediate representation between the source code and the execution engine, allowing for efficient manipulation and analysis of program structure.

## Dependencies

- `lexer` - For token types used in AST nodes

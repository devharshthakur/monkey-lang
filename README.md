# Monkey-Lang Interpreter & Compiler in Rust

This project is an interpreter and compiler for the Monkey programming language, inspired by the book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball](https://interpreterbook.com/). 

Unlike the original implementation in Go, this project is written in **Rust** and aims to provide a modern, safe, and efficient version of the Monkey language tools.

## Project Goals
- Faithfully implement the Monkey language as described in the book
- Provide both an interpreter and a compiler
- Leverage Rust's safety and performance features
- Serve as a learning resource for Rust and language implementation

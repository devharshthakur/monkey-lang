# Always Use Agent.md Context

- Always read and reference `agent.md` at the start of any coding task or query
- Use `agent.md` as the primary source of truth for:
  - Project structure and architecture
  - Technology stack and dependencies
  - Development setup and commands
  - Coding conventions and standards
  - Current implementation status
  - Testing patterns and helpers
- Before making changes, verify they align with the project structure documented in `agent.md`
- When suggesting new features or changes, check `agent.md` to ensure they fit the project's scope and architecture
- Reference `agent.md` when explaining project context or answering questions about the codebase
- If `agent.md` appears outdated, suggest running `/update-agent` command to refresh it

# AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

This crate defines the Abstract Syntax Tree structures for the Monkey language. It provides the foundational data types that represent parsed Monkey code in a structured, hierarchical format.

The AST serves as an intermediate representation between the source code and the execution engine, allowing for efficient manipulation and analysis of program structure. It captures the syntactic structure of Monkey programs, including expressions, statements, and their relationships, enabling downstream components to process and evaluate code.
